Step 25

We now see, at the bottom of the graph, an instance of the letter Nun from a different recording. Its location is, more or less, were the previous bottom instance was. This instance has 2 main problems with it - its base is going to much to the right, generating a risk of confusing it with a Beth (although it is certainly not a Beth, as for Beth the head is as long as the base), and its neck is straight when it should be diagonal (like it was with the previous Nun). 

Although this instance is worst when it comes to recognizing it and using it in sentences,  it does have its crown. The crown is not perfect, but there are definitely 3 lines going up on top of the instance's head.

When you're ready, please continue to the next step.
