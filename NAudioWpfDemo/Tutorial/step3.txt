Step 3

We ran the algorithm using the default parameters values on the selected WAV file. 

You can't see anything clear yet. What you can notice, by scrolling down, is that the top half of the image is a vertical mirror of the bottom (anything at the top is upside down relative to the bottom). The fact that the top is a vertical mirror of the bottom is not some trick of this software, but it is a known feature of the FFT algorithm, which is the most basic and most common algorithm for digital signal processing (DSP).

We will now insert the predefined values that will present a recognizable letter.

When you're ready, please continue to the next step.
