Step 11

We've now set both the green and blue colors to the same power, but we present different hues. The green is only shown for points with hues that are between 1 and 4 (including 1 and 4), and the blue is only shown for hues that are between 5 and 255.

At the bottom of the image, there are 2 instances of the letter. One is blue and the other is green.

We will now go back to the settings that showed one recognizable instance of the letter, but we'll use them with a different recording.

When you're ready, please continue to the next step.
