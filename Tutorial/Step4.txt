step 4

We have imported the predefined settings that present a single instance of the letter and ran the algorithm.

The letter should appear at the bottom of the image (scroll down to see it).

If you are perceptive, you may notice that on the top of the recognizable letter, there is a small instance of the same letter. If you are extremely perceptive, you can even see that at the bottom of the image there's a black space in the shape of that letter (more or less).

Please notice that what we used to present that instance of the letter is the min/max text boxes that specify the range of presented magnitudes. What the max magnitude text box mean is that if at a given sample t, frequency f had a higher magnitude than the max magnitude, it won't be displayed. The same goes for the min magnitude text box. This is a very basic and simple linear, time-invariant filter. The usage of filters in digital signal processing is standard, and usually much more complex filters are used. See wikipedia/google for further informations on DSP filters.

To enable the use of the specific ranges, you need to check the "Use Mag range instead of powers" check box. It is currently checked.

Please continue to the next step when you're ready.
